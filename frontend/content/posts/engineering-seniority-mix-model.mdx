# Engineering Organization Seniority-Mix Model

One of the trademarks of private equity ownership is the expectation that either the company maintains their current margin and grows revenue at 25-30%, or they instead grow slower and increase their free cash flow year over year. In many organizations, engineering costs have a major impact on their free cash flow. There are many costs to reduce, cloud hosting and such, but inevitably part of the discussion is addressing engineering headcount costs directly.

One of the largest contributors to engineering headcount costs is your organization's seniority mix: more senior engineers are paid quite a bit more than earlier career engineers. This model looks at how various policies impact an organization's seniority mix.

In this article, we'll work to:

1. Summarize this model's learnings about policy impact on seniority mix
2. Sketch the model's stocks and flows
3. Use [lethain/systems](https://github.com/lethain/systems) to iteratively build and exercise the full model

## Key Learnings

An organization without a "backfill at N-1" hiring policy, e.g. an organization that hires a SWE2 to replace a departed SWE2, will have an increasingly top-heavy organization over time.

However, even introducing the "backfill at N-1" hiring policy is insufficient, as our representation in senior levels will become far too high, even if we stop hiring externally into our senior-most levels.

To fully accomplish our goal of a healthy seniority mix, we must stop hiring at senior-most levels, implement a "backfill at N-1" policy, and cap the maximum number of individual at the senior-most level.

Any collection of lower-powered policies simply will not impact the model's outcome.

## Sketching the System

We'll start by sketching this system in [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/). It's always fine to use whatever tool you prefer, but in general the lack of complexity in simple sketching tools focuses you on iterating on the stocks and flows–without getting distracted by tuning settings–much like a designer starting with messy wireframes rather than pixel-perfect designs.

We'll start with sketching the junior-most level: SWE1.

![SWE1 level sketch](/images/blog/seniority-model/eng-costs-sketch-1.png)

We hire external candidates to become SWE1s. We have some get promoted to SWE2, some depart, and then backfill those departures with new SWE1s.

![SWE1 and SWE2 levels sketch](/images/blog/seniority-model/eng-costs-sketch-2.png)

As we start sketching the full stocks and flows for SWE2, we also introduce the idea of backfilling at the prior level. As we replicate this pattern for two more career levels–SWE3 and SWE4–we get the complete model.

![Complete model sketch](/images/blog/seniority-model/eng-costs-sketch-4.png)

The final level, SWE4, is simplified relative to the prior levels, as it's no longer possible to get promoted to a further level. We could go further than this, but the model will simply get increasingly burdensome to work with, so let's stop with four levels.

## Reasoning Through the Model

Reviewing the sketched system, a few interesting conclusions come out:

1. If promotion rates at any level exceed the rate of hiring at that level plus rate of N-1 backfill at that level, then the proportion of engineers at that level will grow over time
2. If you are not hiring much, then this problem simplifies to promotion rate versus departure rate. A company that does little hiring and high retention cannot afford to promote frequently
3. Many companies use the "career level" policy as the mechanism to identify a level where promotions *generally* stop happening. The rationale is often not explicitly described, but we can conclude it's likely a financial constraint that typically incentivizes this policy

## Building and Testing the Model

We're going to build this model using [lethain/systems](https://github.com/lethain/systems). The first version will be relatively simple, albeit with a number of stocks given the size of the model, and then we'll layer on additional features as we iteratively test different scenarios.

### Backfill-at-level Policy

The first policy we're going to explore is backfilling a departure at the same level. For example, if a SWE2 departs, then you go ahead and backfill them at SWE2. This intuitively makes sense, because you needed a SWE2 before to perform the work, so why would you hire something less senior?

Our initial model is defined as:

```
HiringRate(2)

[Candidates] > SWE1(10) @ HiringRate
SWE1 > DepartedSWE1 @ Leak(0.1)
DepartedSWE1 > SWE1 @ Leak(0.5)

Candidates > SWE2(10) @ HiringRate
SWE1 > SWE2 @ Leak(0.1)
SWE2 > DepartedSWE2 @ Leak(0.1)
DepartedSWE2 > SWE2 @ Leak(0.5)

Candidates > SWE3(10) @ HiringRate
SWE2 > SWE3 @ Leak(0.1)
SWE3 > DepartedSWE3 @ Leak(0.1)
DepartedSWE3 > SWE3 @ Leak(0.5)

Candidates > SWE4(0)  @ HiringRate
SWE3 > SWE4 @ Leak(0.1)
SWE4 > DepartedSWE4 @ Leak(0.1)
DepartedSWE4 > SWE4 @ Leak(0.5)
```

Running that model, we can see how the populations of the various levels grow over time.

This backfill-at-level policy is inefficient, because our organization just becomes more and more top-heavy with SWE4s over time. Something needs to change.

### Backfill at N-1 Policy

To reduce the number of SWE4s in our company, let's update the model to backfill all hires at the level below the departed employee. For example, a departing SWE2 would cause hiring a SWE1.

Running this updated model, we get a better looking organization.

![Model results with backfill-at-N-1 policy](/images/blog/seniority-model/eng-costs-model-3.png)

We're still top-heavy, but we've turned an exponential growth problem into a linear growth problem, so that's an improvement. However, this is still a very expensive engineering organization to run, and certainly *not* an organization that's reducing costs.

### No External Hiring Policy

One reason our model shows so many SWE4s is because we're hiring at an even rate across all levels, which isn't particularly realistic. Also, it's unlikely that we're growing headcount at all to the extent that we're aiming to reduce our engineering costs over time.

We can model this by setting a `HiringRate` of zero, and then setting more representative initial values for each cohort of engineers.

Running the model gives us an updated perspective.

![Model results with no external hiring](/images/blog/seniority-model/eng-costs-model-4.png)

We can see that eliminating hiring *improves* the ratio of SWE4s to the other levels, but it's still just too high. We're ending up with roughly 1.25 SWE1s for each SWE4, when the ratio should be closer to five to one.

### Capped Senior Level Policy

Finally, we're going to introduce a stock with a maximum size. No matter what flows *want* to accomplish, they cannot grow a flow over that maximum. In this case, we're defining `SWE4` as a stock with an initial size of 10, and a maximum size of 20.

With that one change, we're getting close to an engineering organization that works how we want.

![Model results with capped senior level](/images/blog/seniority-model/eng-costs-model-5.png)

The ratio of SWE4s to other functions is right, although we can see that the backpressure means that we have a surplus of SWE3s in this organization. You could imagine other policy work that might improve that as well, e.g. presumably more SWE3s depart than SWE2s, because the SWE3s see their ability to be promoted is capped by the departure rate of existing SWE4s.

## Conclusion

This model demonstrates that managing the seniority mix in an engineering organization requires a combination of policies:

1. Implementing a "backfill at N-1" hiring policy
2. Capping the number of positions at the most senior levels
3. Limiting external hiring at senior levels

Without these policies in place, organizations will naturally drift toward becoming top-heavy, which increases costs and can create career progression bottlenecks.

By using systems thinking and modeling, we can better understand the long-term implications of our hiring and promotion policies, leading to more sustainable engineering organizations.
